[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

Google Cloud Trace SDK for Java is a Java library that provides tools, best practices, and examples for integrating with Google Cloud Trace, a feature of Google Cloud Platform that collects, displays, and analyzes latency data from applications.

We're making some revisions to the API, and we'll update the documentation when the new version is ready. Stay tuned!
